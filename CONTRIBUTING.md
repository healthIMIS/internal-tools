# Contributing

First, thank you for considering contributing to our project.  
We appreciate people using and improving our setup!

Please follow these guidelines when contributing to this project.  
This helps us to manage contributions and eases the communication between contributors and our developers.  
We will in return try to support you with your pull requests or answer to your questions as good as we can.

# How can I contribute?

We are open for any kind of contribution, as long as it adds value to the setup, matches the intention of the
project and does not contradict our own usage of the setup too much.  

You can contribute by:
- fixing a bug
- writing an issue when you encountered a problem or bug
- writing documentation
- adding a new service to the setup (e.g. markdown editor, time-scheduling tool, ...)
- adding support for another operating system
- providing an example configuration for a specific use case

If you can think of other types of contributions, even this can be a contribution and you could add it above.
