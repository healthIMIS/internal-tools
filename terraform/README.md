# Some proxmox terraform templates

- 'lxc-pure.tf': Debian 11 container for running applications within
- 'lxc-docker.tf': Debian 11 container capable of hosting embedded docker containers

Goal: create those containers with ansible (call terraform from ansible).

For testing, replace the values in Brackets <> with yours.
