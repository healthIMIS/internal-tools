# Internal Tool Setup
This repository will host our internal open source tool setup which will contain productivity tools for text- and video chat, file storage with editing and collaboration features and more tools for internal use-cases.  
It is also used for planning and evaluating possible tools.  

**This is work in progress. Do not use it in live systems!**  
As soon as this repository contains a complete setup which is ready to be used, there will be a *release*.
